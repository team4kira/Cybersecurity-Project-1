The subsequent blog was developed as part of a project within the University of Toronto's Cybersecurity Bootcamp Program. Attached to the repository are the HTML and CSS files used to create said Web Application. HTML and CSS files were pre-defined in the Cybersecurity Course and the task was to create a blog using the pre-defined template. Both blog posts focus on Cybersecuity breaches and mitigation techniques that could have helped prevent said breaches. A rendered version of blog posts and HTML/CSS edits can be found [here](https://team4kira.github.io/Cybersecurity-Project-1/index.html). You can find the Topology-Visualization of Web Application [here](https://github.com/team4kira/Topology/blob/main/README.md).
